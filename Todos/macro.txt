Macros:
- Macro interpreter and editor:
runs on the source code file once, 
every time we encounter "macro" #some_name and end.
the use of the macro should apear straight after 
the macro decleration. 

as soon as we encounter the use of the macro variable we replace 
it with the macro content we just saved. 
we run on the source file while create a copy
of the source file content in different file that will contain
the same source code but without macros variables,.
