Word Builder:
- Build Words.

Getters:
we'll use getters or setters depends on the
implementation we decide on. One option is to create
struct type that will hold temporarely for each line its parsed
state data. it will be something similliar to this:

typedef struct {
    char addrType (A/R/E character);
    unsigned int opcode (Decimal);
} firstWord;

typedef struct {
    char addrTyoe (A/R/E);
    unsigned int funct;
    unsigned int srcReg;
    unsigned int srcAddr;
    unsigned int desReg;
    unsigned int desAddr;
} secondWord;

typedef struct
{
    unsigned int base;
    unsigned int offset
} operandAddr;

union struct {
    firstWord,
    secondWord
    operandAddr
} Word;

- Get/Set Opcode
- Get/Set functCode
- Get/Set base address
- Get/Set offset
- Get/Set srcAddr/desAddr
- Get/Set srcReg/desReg
