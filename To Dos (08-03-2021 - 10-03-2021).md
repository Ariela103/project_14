# Shahar Tasks: (08-03-2021 - 10-03-2021)
# 1) create/fix current the function with the signature "Bool countAndVerifyDataArguments(char *token)" in firstRun.c (file)
The Function should perform 2 main tasks:
### 1.A) verify that the string of arguments passed to the .data instruction have a correct syntax, 
if a there is a mistake in the syntax, the function should yieldError relevant message and return False. (you can just return yieldError(some error) which will return False value by it self). after checking and verifying that the string of arguments have a correct syntax  (after you finished looping over the string and before the end of the function, before "return lineParsedSuccessfully") you should :
### 1.B) increase DC counter by the size of the current instruction. 
The size of the instruction is just the amount of arguments in the string.
for example, ".data -3" size is 1, ".data 6,5,7" is 3. you should calculate the size 
of ths instruction inside loop that checks if the arguments syntax is correct,
every time you detect that a token is a number and not a ',' or illegal character, 
you increase "x" (some int variable) by 1 (you do x++).
if you encountered an error in the syntax it will happen while you are inside the loop and
then you will return False from the function and exit without increasing DC counter by the arguments number
you counted.

If you finished looping the string it means that the syntax is correct and you have a variable (we called "x")
that is actually the size of the current .data instruction and you can increase the DC counter with its value.
to increase DC you just call increaseDataCounter(int amount) with "x" increaseDataCounter(x);

## few things you should keep in mind when parsing/analyizing the arguments string syntax:

#### - the correct syntax of commas should: 
verify that between each two integer arguments there is exacly 1 ',' token and NOT ',' at all before the first argument and after the last argument. "3, 4,6" legal while ", 3,4,6," total illegal.

#### - Argument must be an integer number with a plus/minus sign. 
if you encounter '.' straight within a number token you should yield error that says that number must be integer and can not hold floating point number. you can check if a '.' exist inside a number by doing "sscanf(token, "%d%c", &number, &c);"
c variable will hold '.' value in that case.

#### - char *token argument passed to the function you write 
holds the full string of arguments apear on the current instruction after ".data" token... BUT that string  is already locked inside an active strtok function that is splitting the string by space characters, the strtok was activated on it before it passed to the function So, at every moment "token" variable holds only one token. So, inside the loop where you verify the syntax (at the end of each loop iteration), in order to get the next token you should call "token = strtok(NULL, " \t \n")". 

Keep in mind that the line arguments are splitted by space characters, so there could be a case that you will get 1 token that holds all of the arguments seperated by ',' without any space between them, for example, this "7,-4,6" will apear to be a single token. 
There are few ways in which you can handle this kind of scenario. one way will be using something with using sscanf(), for example: "sscanf(token, "%d%c%d", &firstNumber, &c, &secondNumber)". 
You can also use strchr(token, ',') that will return you a pointer to the first appearance of the ',' character inside the token if it apears, you can change the value of token arguments to be strchr(token,',') + 1 which will look something like this (inside the loop where you check syntax):

if((token = strchr(token, ',')!=NULL)){
token = strchr(token, ',');
token++;
} else token = strtok(NULL, " \t \n");


# 2) create/fix current the function with the signature "Bool countAndVerifyStringArguments(char *token)" in firstRun.c (file):
 that do the same thing but for a .string instruction arguments like "Abccdefef".
